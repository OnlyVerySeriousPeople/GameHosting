# GameHosting

GameHosting is a simple multiplayer game hosting platform built using a microservice architecture. It enables lightweight, scalable hosting of real-time multiplayer games with support for rooms, teams, and game state management.

The system is composed of multiple services written in both TypeScript and C#, communicating over gRPC using Protocol Buffers, allowing for clean service boundaries and polyglot development.

## Features:

- ‚öôÔ∏è Microservice-based design for modularity and scalability
- üîÅ Cross-language service communication via gRPC and Protobuf
- üéÆ Host simple multiplayer games with team/room logic (synchronization can be implemented via WebSocket messages)
